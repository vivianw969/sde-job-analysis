Strategic Job Search for International Software Developers: Analyzing Job Availability, Sponsorship Rates, and Livability Across U.S. States

This project analyzes the distribution of software engineering job opportunities, visa sponsorship rates, competitive salaries, and livability factors across U.S. states. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help international students make informed job search and relocation decisions while assisting employers in attracting top international talent.

The project leverages Power BI and SQL Server for ETL and data processing. Power BI is used for data integration, transformation, and visualization, utilizing Power Query Editor to filter, merge, and aggregate data. SQL Server is employed for data profiling, cleaning, and ensuring data quality, addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and format standardization. The final analysis offers a data-driven approach to optimizing job search strategies for international professionals in the U.S. job market.
